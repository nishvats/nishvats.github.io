    <h2>Financial Approach to Environmental Sustainability</h2>
   August 2022<br><br>
    The past few years have seen many actors in the financial system take sustainability into account in their decision-making. In this post, I paint a broad picture of the related efforts and how they interact with one another. <br>

    <h2>Standard way to cluster standard errors</h2>
   May 2022<br><br>
    Clustering standard errors can make or break papers. In this post, I discuss what are considered standard approaches to clustering standard errors, particularly focusing on asset pricing and corporate settings. I benefited from discussions with Fulin Li. <br>

    <h2>Financial Markets in Monetary Policy</h2>
   March 2022<br><br>
    Central banks already come equipped with the dual goal of price stability and financial stability. In this post, I explore existing literature that explores the role of financial stability considerations in monetary policy, above and beyond its traditional financial stability tools. <br>

    <h2>Fixing Identification with Fixed Effects</h2>
   February 2022<br><br>
    With the broader availability of panel data, fixed effects (FE) regression models are becoming important and used widely for identifying causal effects. In this post, I discuss a few papers in which the usage of fixed effects is quite illuminating. I have benefited from discussion with Gurpal S. Sran. <br>

    <h2>Finance Questions for DeFi</h2>
   January 2022<br><br>
    The developments in DeFi, or decentralized finance, are much quicker than accompanied advances in academic discourse. In this post, I organize some questions based on my preliminary readings that will help us keep up with the fast-changing landscape. I plan on updating this list as the landscape evolves. <br>

    <h2>Measurement Matters</h2>
   December 2021<br><br>
    Much of academic discourse depends on a set of rigorously established “stylized facts.” Providing such facts rely on sound measurement, which is often harder than it seems. I discuss three recent examples that are worth noting. <br>

    <h2>Elon's Natural Experiment</h2>
   November 2021<br><br>
    On November 6th, 2021, Elon Musk tweeted that he would sell 10% of his stake in Tesla following the outcome of a Twitter poll. In this post, I use this episode as a lens into theories of asset demand and their role for prices. I have benefited greatly from discussions with Aditya Chaudhry. <br>

    <h2>Replicating Portfolios</h2>
   October 2021<br><br>
    A recent body of work extends the replicating portfolio approach to provide insights into valuation and measurement of key assets and entities of interest. In this post, I discuss some innovative examples that are worth noting. <br>

    <h2>Selection Bias in Finance</h2>
   September 2021<br><br>
    In this post, I summarize some famous examples of selection bias in finance and economics. Hopefully they serve as a useful reminder that even when identification and estimation are sound, there are always lingering concerns about external validity. <br>

    <h2>Skewness Strikes Back</h2>
   July 2021<br><br>
    Skewness in the distribution of economic outcomes is underappreciated. In this post, I summarize some basic insights regarding skewness in three themes. I also describe why I think now is a particularly interesting time to focus on skewness.<br>

    <h2>Levels vs. Changes</h2>
   May 2021<br><br>
    In many empirical models within finance, one needs to decide whether to use variables as their levels or their changes. In this post, I briefly go over reasons why one may chooses one versus the other.<br>

   January 2021<br><br>
    In this post, I explore the variations in Structural VARs (SVARs) and their recent applications. This is mostly an amalgam of notes based on my readings of multiple lecture notes, papers, and documentations.<br>

    <h2>Programming in Stata vs. Python</h2>
   December 2020<br><br>
    Recently, I've spent some time implementing a particular task in both Stata and in Python. Despite this <a href="http://www.danielmsullivan.com/pages/tutorial_stata_to_python.html">very useful reference</a>, I've had a lot of struggle getting the output in both platforms exactly identical. Here is a list of things to watch out for when you're puzzled by why the two sets of code yield different output.<br>

    <h2>Expectation Extraction</h2>
   September 2020<br><br>
    Asset prices and portfolio holdings encode information about investor beliefs about the future and about investors' concerns for risk. A natural empirical exercise is to use the financial market data to extract such information. In this post, I briefly outline a few approaches that have emerged recently.<br>

   <h2>Khwaja-Mian (2008) Estimator</h2>
   July 2020<br><br>
   In this post, I explain the Khwaja-Mian (2008) estimator, which is a technique used to control for credit demand shocks in order to identify credit supply shocks i.e. the "bank lending channel." Authors introduce time-variant firm fixed effects to fully capture the demand for credit by focusing on firms with multiple banking relationships. They actually do more than this, but subsequent papers citing this paper only refer to the inclusion of fixed effects.<br>
